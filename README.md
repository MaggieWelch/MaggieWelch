# Maggie's Github Profile 👩‍💻

My name is Maggie Welch, and I am currently a fourth year at The University of Virginia majoring in Psychology 🧠 with a minor in Data Science 📊. 

I am interested in developmental psychology, specifically in the development of childhood psychopathology, as well as clinical methods to improve quality of life. 

My github contains projects and assignments from my data science minor, where I learn how to make meaningful insights from data, as well as hone my skills in other aspects of the data science field. 

My other interests include UVA basketball 🏀, cooking 🥗, and music 🎶!
